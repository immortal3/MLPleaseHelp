/* To add new resource entries, make a new dict-like entry at the top of the mlAssets array, like the one below:
{
    "Name": "Parris",
    "Description": "Parris, the automated infrastructure setup tool for machine learning algorithms.",
    "Link": "https://github.com/jgreenemi/Parris",
    "Keywords": "Python, AWS",
    "LastUpdatedDate": "2018/01/28",
},

Note:
- Add new entries to the top of the array, that way the newest entries show up at the top of the page.
- LastUpdatedDate does not get used in the engine, just helps to keep track of when entries were last changed.
- Keywords is a string, not a list. Commas are encouraged for readability but not required.
- Only link to the original repository or the resource's original website, not a blog post or other middle-man
  page, unless that post or article *is* the resource to be shared.
- Entries are displayed in the order they were added to the list. In the future I may introduce logic to do some other
  sorting (i.e. by LastUpdatedDate) but this will depend on what the community finds useful.
